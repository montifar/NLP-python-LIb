# NLP-python-LIb

The program demonstrates a basic Natural Language Processing pipeline using the NLTK and spaCy libraries. It starts by downloading important NLTK resources such as the tokenizer and the English stopwords list. The text is then tokenized, which means breaking the sentence into individual words and punctuation marks. After tokenization, the tokens are converted into lowercase to ensure consistency during analysis. The program removes stopwords next, keeping only meaningful words that contribute to the understanding of the text. Using spaCy, it performs Part-of-Speech tagging to identify the grammatical role of each word in the sentence. It also applies Named Entity Recognition to detect important entities such as names, topics, or technical fields. This entire code was executed in Google Colab, showing how raw text can be processed and analyzed in a cloud-based environment.
